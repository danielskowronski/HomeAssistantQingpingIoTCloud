# Qingping IoT Cloud integration for Home Assistant

Home Assistant integration for Qingping IoT Cloud using [qingping-iot-cloud](https://github.com/danielskowronski/qingping-iot-cloud) library.

For full context check [library docs](https://github.com/danielskowronski/qingping-iot-cloud), but in short this integration is for accessing Wi-Fi devices paired with Qingping IoT Cloud instead of Bluetooth.

***THIS IS WORK IN PROGRESS***
